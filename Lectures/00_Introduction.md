- Professors
    - Lectures: Nicolae Cleju
    - Laboratories: Irina Pavel

- Time schedule

- My office hours: *To Be Announced* (best by appointment)


### Evaluation

- Exam
    - 60% of final grade
    - Consists of both theory questions and exercises
    - Many small questions (like in Information Theory exam), both for theory and exercises

- Applications
	- 40% of final grade
	- Laboratory
        - in Matlab / Simulink
		- grade will be computed from:
		- a). activity throughout semester (10%)
		- b). final laboratory practical test in Matlab / Simulink (10%)
	- Intermediate tests
		- 20% of final grade
		- 3 tests: in Week 5, Week 8 and Week 11
		- test = one exercise, 30 minutes, during lecture or laboratory (will be decided)
