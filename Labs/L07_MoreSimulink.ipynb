    "   - Linearity:  \n",

    "## 3. Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a Simulink model to implement the following system $H_1$:\n",
    "$$y[n] = H_1\\{x[n]\\} = 0.8 y[n-1] + 0.25 x[n]  + 0.1 x[n-1]$$\n",
    "    - the system should be implemented as a Subsystem block with one input and one output signal\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Try to guess what type of filter this is, low-pass or high-pass, by putting some signal at the input and looking at the output. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Test linearity of this system by checking if the linearity equation holds\n",
    "    - create multiple copies of the system inside the model (copy/paste)\n",
    "    - use two randomly generated input vectors `x` and `y` (use one of the *Random* blocks), and some two constants `a` and `b`\n",
    "    - check that the output of the system when the input is `a*x + b*y` is exactly equal to the weighted sum of the outputs applied separately to `x` and `y`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Test time-invariance in a similar way\n",
    "    - the system will be applied to an input vector `x`, and to  `x` prepended with a variable number of zeros (i.e. time delayed)\n",
    "    - the outputs shall be checked if they verify the time invariance equation\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Find an input signal $x[n]$ to show that the system $y[n] = y[n-1] + x[n]$ is unstable.\n",
    "Show it by simulating the model and displaying the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Implement and apply the following  system to the audio data (mp3 file) loaded with FromMultimediaFile and play the resulting output (ToAudioSink). How is the sound affected?\n",
    " \n",
    "    $$y[n] = \\frac{1}{5} \\cdot \\left( -0.7 y[n-1] + x[n] + 0.5 x[n-1] \\right)$$\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Make sure you set the properties of the *From Multimedia File* block as shown above\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Change the system to the following and check how it sounds:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$y[n] = \\frac{1.7}{0.5} \\cdot \\left( 0.7 y[n-1] + x[n] - 0.5 x[n-1] \\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Test the linearity and the time invariance for two other systems as well:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - $y[n] = \\left( x[n] \\right)^2 + 0.1 x[n] + \\sqrt{x[n]})$\n",
    "    - $y[n] = n \\cdot x[n] + x[n-1]$\n",
