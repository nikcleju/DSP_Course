    "## 1. Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "Students should understand and be able to operate with video data in Matlab.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Theoretical aspects\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. 1 Representation of video sequences \n",
    "\n",
    "A video sequence is just a sequence of images displayed with speed high enough to \"fool the eye\" into thinking it sees a continuous movement.\n",
    "As a consequence, a video sequence can be represented as an array of images. The images are known as \"frames\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: there is a difference between how a video sequence is stored to disk (with compression) and the raw uncompressed data. Here we talk about the uncompressed video data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Grayscale video\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, we consider only grayscale video in this laboratory. Since a grayscale image is a matrix, a grayscale video can be represented as a 4D tensor with dimensions (H, W, 1, NoF), where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- H = height of video (number of rows)\n",
    "- W = width of image (number of columns)\n",
    "- NoF = number of frames (number of distinct images in the video).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, V(20, 50, 1, 7) is the pixel value for the pixel at row 20, column 50, in the 7th frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Color video\n",
    "\n",
    "In case of a color video, the data structure is a tensor with dimensions (H, W, 3, NoF). We have three components for the RGB values. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, V(20, 50, 2, 7) is the Green value (2) of the pixel at row 20, column 50, in the 7th frame of the video.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Matlab functions for video handling\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple ways of handling video data in Matlab, depending on how it is represented. In the following, the recommended way is to work with 4D tensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following we provide code templates for working with video data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2.1 Creating and playing videos as 4D tensor\n",
    "\n",
    "A video is a 4_ tensor of shape (H, W, 1, NoF) (grayscale) or (H, W, 3, NoF) (color).\n",
    "\n",
    "We play the video with `implay()`.\n",
