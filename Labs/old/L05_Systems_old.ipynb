    "## 3. Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a function `mysys1()` that implements the following system $H_1$:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$y[n] = H_1\\{x[n]\\} = \\frac{1}{4} x[n] - \\frac{1}{2} x[n-1] + \\frac{1}{4} x[n-2]$$\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - The function takes one input argument `x` and outputs one vector `y`\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Test the function by running it in on the following input signal $x$: 20 zeros, followed by 20 ones, repeated 5 times\n",
    "  \n",
    "    - Plot the original signal $x$ and the output signal $y$ on the same graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Check the linearity of the system in `mysys1()`, by checking if the linearity equation holds, in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - generate two random vectors `x1` and `x2` of some length (e.g. 500) and two random numbers `a` and `b`\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - apply the system (e.g. the function `mysys1`) to `a*x1`, `b*x2`, and `a*x1 + b*x2`, and check if the results verify the linearity equation: the sum of the first two results must be equal to the third\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Create a function to test the linearity of a system, `test_linear()`, in the manner described above.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - the function shall take one input argument, a function handle of the system function, e.g. the function will be called as `test_linear(@mysys1)`\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - inside, the function shall do exactly the same procedure as above: generate two random vectors and two constants, apply the system to `a*x1`, `b*x2`, and `a*x1 + b*x2`, and shall check if the results verify the linearity equation\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - the check shall be repeated for 5 times, with 5 different randomly generated data\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - if the linearity equation holds every time, the function shall return 1; otherwise the return value shall be 0\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Run the function for the `mysys1()` function in Exercise 1, and check whether it is linear or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Create functions for the following systems as well, and check if they are linear:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$y[n] = H_1\\{x[n]\\} = n \\cdot x[n] + 5$$\n",
    "    \n",
    "    $$y[n] = x[n] + 0.5 x[n-1] + 1$$\n",
    "    \n",
    "    $$y[n] = (x[n])^2 + 4$$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Implement a similar function to **check the time invariance** of a system, following the same approach. We can check time invariance in the following way:\n",
    "   \n",
    "    - Apply the system to some random vector `x`. Let's call the result `y`.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Apply the system to `x` prepended with K values zeros (i.e. delayed by $K$ samples). $K$ can be anything between 1 and whatever. Let's call the result `y2`.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - If the system is time invariant, the vector `y` should be identical to the vector `y2` starting after position $K$ (from (K+1) onwards).\n",

    "TBD"
