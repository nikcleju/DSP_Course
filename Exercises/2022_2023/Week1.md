1. Are the following signals periodic? If yes, compute their period.
    a. $x[n] = cos(\pi \frac{3}{10} n)$
    a. $x[n] = cos(7.2 \pi n)$
    a. $x[n] = sin(3n)$
    a. $x[n] = sin(\frac{\pi n}{2}) + cos(\frac{3 \pi n}{4})$


2. Consider the following signal: 
$$x_a(t) = (1 + 0.5 cos(400 \pi t)) \cdot cos(8000 \pi t)$$

    a. Compute the minimum sampling frequency necessary for avoiding alias
    b. The signal is sampled with 8000Hz. Write the discrete signal obtained via sampling.
    c. What is the analog signal reconstructed from the samples via ideal D/A reconstruction?
