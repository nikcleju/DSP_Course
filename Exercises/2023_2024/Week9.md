**Left-overs from last week:**

4. Consider a periodic signal $x[n]$ with period $N=5$ and the DFT coefficients:

   $X_k$ = [15.0000 + 0.0000i , -2.5000 + 3.4410i , -2.5000 + 0.8123i , -2.5000 - 0.8123i , -2.5000 - 3.4410i]

   Write $x[n]$ as a sum of sinusoids.

5. Find the DFT coefficients of the periodic signal with period $\{1, 1, 0, 0\}$,
and write the signal as a sum of sinusoidal components.

6. Write the DFT calculation in Ex.5 as a matrix multiplication.

7. Compute $x[n]$ in Ex.3 and Ex.4, in two ways:

   - using the definition formula
   - using the matrix form
