**Left-overs from last week:**

7. Compute $x[n]$ in Ex.3 and Ex.4, in two ways:

   - using the definition formula
   - using the matrix form

<!-- 1. Find the DTFT of the signal $\{1, 1, 0, 0\}$, considering it is surrounded with infinitely-long zeros on both sides.

	Discussion: What is the relation of this DTFT with the DFT of exercise 5 from last week? -->
