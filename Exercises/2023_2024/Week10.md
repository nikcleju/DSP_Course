**Left-overs from last week:**

7. Compute $x[n]$ in Ex.3 and Ex.4, in two ways:

   - using the definition formula
   - using the matrix form

**New exercises**

<!-- 1. Find the DTFT of the signal $\{1, 1, 0, 0\}$, considering it is surrounded with infinitely-long zeros on both sides.

	Discussion: What is the relation of this DTFT with the DFT of exercise 5 from last week? -->

1. A signal $x[n]$ has a Z transform with one pole $p_1 = -0.5$ and one zero $z_1 = 0.9$.
It is known that at $\omega = \pi$, the modulus of the Fourier transform is $|X(\omega=\pi)| = 1$.
    a. Find the signals's Z transform $X(z)$
    b. Compute the expression of $|X(\omega)|$ and $\angle X(\omega)$
    c. Find the values $|X(\frac{\pi}{2})|$, $|X(\frac{-\pi}{2})|$ and $|X(0)|$
    d. Sketch $|X(\omega)|$

\smallskip

2. Design the pole-zero plot of a signal with:
    - low frequency content
    - frequency content around the frequency $\omega = \frac{\pi}{2}$
