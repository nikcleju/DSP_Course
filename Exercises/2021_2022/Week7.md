Left-over from last week:

2. A causal LTI system has the property that if the input signal is 
$$x[n] = \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^n u[n] - \frac{1}{4} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^n u[n-1],$$
then the output signal is
$$y[n] = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right)^n u[n]$$

    a. Find the system function H(z), draw the pole-zero diagram
    b. Compute the impulse response $h[n]$ of the system
    c. Find the difference equation of the system
    d. Characterize the system with respect to:
        - length of impulse response (FIR or IIR)
        - implementation (recursive or non-recursive)
        - stability
