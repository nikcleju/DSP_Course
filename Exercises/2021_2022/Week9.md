**The remaining exercises from Week 8:**


4. Consider a periodic signal $x[n]$ with period $N=5$ and the DFT coefficients:
    
   $X_k$ = [15.0000 + 0.0000i , -2.5000 + 3.4410i , -2.5000 + 0.8123i , -2.5000 - 0.8123i , -2.5000 - 3.4410i]
  
   Write $x[n]$ as a sum of sinusoids.
    
5. Find the DFT coefficients of the periodic signal with period $\{1, 1, 0, 0\}$,
and write the signal as a sum of sinusoidal components.

6. Find the DTFT of the signal $\{1, 1, 0, 0\}, considering it is surrounded with infinitely-long zeros on both sides
